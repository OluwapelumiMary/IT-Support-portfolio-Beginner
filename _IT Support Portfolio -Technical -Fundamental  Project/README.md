## ðŸš€ Project Pitch
 This is my first hands-on technical foundation in IT Support. Built through self-paced learning and real-world simulation, I was able to blend critical thinking with tech knowledge to solve real problems, creating impact through constant practice and reflection. I've begun to navigate the core responsibilities of an entry-level IT professional confidently.

## ðŸ“š Study Summary
I completed all five modules of the Google IT Support Certificate:
1. **Module 1** â€“ IT Support

3. **Module 3** â€“ Operating Systems
4. **Module 4** â€“ Networking & Internet

Each module includes a unique scenario, infographic, or explainer slide created on Canva. The following materials are included below, along with a summary of the tools, lessons learned, and real-life applications.
